**Biography**
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; text-align: justify;">
    I am a final-year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department, Rutgers University, under the supervision of Prof. 
    <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Desheng Zhang</a>. 
    I also work closely with Prof. 
    <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~tianhe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tian He</a> 
    and Prof. 
    <a href="http://www.yunhuai.net/Yunhuai.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yunhuai Liu</a>.

<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; text-align: justify;">
    My research interests broadly lie in <strong>Human-centric Cyber-Physical Systems</strong>, <strong>Data Science</strong>, 
    <strong>Generative AI</strong>, <strong>Mobile Sensing</strong>, and <strong>Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing</strong> for smart cities. 
    My work involves various techniques, such as large language models (LLMs), large sensor models (LSM), efficient machine learning, 
    unsupervised machine learning, cross-domain data fusion, and large-scale system optimization & deployment. I have been investigating 
    platforms across more than 300 cities on 2 continents with 2 billion E-commerce orders, 300 thousand vehicles, 500 thousand mobile 
    devices, and 500 million residents involved.

<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; text-align: justify;">
  My technical contributions have led to more than 20 papers in premium CS venues, e.g., IMWUT/UbiComp, KDD, ICDE, VLDB, EMNLP, TKDE, SIGSPATIAL, CIKM, and SDM. I have served as TPC, PC member or reviewer for top conferences and journals in <em>Mobile Computing</em> (Mobicom Artifact Evaluation, IMWUT/Ubicomp, TOSN) and <em>Data Science and AI</em> (NIPS, ICML, ICLR, TMLR, AISTATS, KDD, AAAI, EMNLP, WWW, DMLR, WSDM, SDM, ICWSM).
