**Biography**
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; text-align: justify;">
    I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University, advised by Prof. 
    <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Desheng Zhang</a> (Associate Professor at Rutgers & Visiting Professor at MIT) and Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hc1m_BQAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tian He</a> (ACM/IEEE Fellow & VP at JD.COM). Starting this summer, I will be a visiting researcher at <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UC Berkeley</a>. In January 2026, I will join the <a href="https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)</a> as an Assistant Professor in <a href="https://iott.hkust-gz.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Information Hub, IoT Thrust</a>.

<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; text-align: justify;">
    My research interests broadly lie in <strong>Generative AI</strong>, <strong>Embodied AI</strong>, <strong>Mobile Sensing</strong>, <strong>Human-centric Cyber-Physical Systems</strong>, <strong>Data Science</strong>, 
    and <strong>Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing</strong> for <strong>Smart Cities</strong>. 
    My work involves various techniques, such as large language models (LLMs), large sensor models (LSM), efficient machine learning, 
    unsupervised machine learning, cross-domain data fusion, and large-scale system optimization & deployment. I have been investigating 
    platforms across more than 300 cities on 2 continents with 2 billion E-commerce orders, 300 thousand vehicles, 500 thousand mobile 
    devices, and 500 million residents involved.

<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; text-align: justify;">
  My technical contributions have led to more than 20 papers in premium CS venues, e.g., MobiCom, IMWUT/UbiComp, KDD, ACL, ICDE, VLDB, EMNLP, TKDE, TMC, SIGSPATIAL, CIKM, and SDM. Several of my algorithms and systems have been adopted by industry, generating measurable real-world impact at a national scale. I have served as TPC, PC member, or reviewer for top conferences and journals in <em>Mobile Computing</em> (Mobicom Artifact Evaluation, IMWUT/Ubicomp, TOSN) and <em>Data Science and AI</em> (NIPS, ICML, ICLR, TMLR, AISTATS, KDD, AAAI, EMNLP, WWW, DMLR, WSDM, SDM, ICWSM).

    I am currently looking for self-motivated PhD/MPhil/Visiting students and RAs, starting from Spring/Fall 2026 at HKUST(GZ). Both remote and in-person Research Interns are welcome and can start from Summer 2025. 
    <br>
    If you are interested, please feel free to contact me at <u>zhiqing.hong@rutgers.edu</u>, with CV, transcript, and a few sentences highlighting anything you believe would strengthen your application! 
    <br>
    Please note that while I carefully read all inquiry emails, due to the large volume, I may not be able to respond to each one individually. Thank you for your understanding.
