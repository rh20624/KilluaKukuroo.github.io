**Biography**

I am a final-year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department, Rutgers University, under the supervision of Prof. [Desheng Zhang](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/). I also work closely with Prof. [Tian He](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~tianhe/) and Prof. [Yunhuai Liu](http://www.yunhuai.net/Yunhuai.htm). 

I have served as TPC, PC member of reviewer for top conferences and journals in *mobile sensing* (Mobicom Artifact Evaluation, Ubicomp, TOSN) and *data science and AI* (NIPS, AISTATS, KDD, AAAI, EMNLP, WWW, DMLR, WSDM, SDM, ICWSM). 
My research interests broadly lie in **Human-Centered Cyber-Physical Systems**, **Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition**, and **Spatio-Temporal Data Mining**. Feel free to reach out at zhiqing.hong AT rutgers DOT edu.
