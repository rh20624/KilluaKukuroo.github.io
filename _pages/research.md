## Research Overview
My research interests broadly lie in Human-centric Cyber-Physical Systems, Data Science, Generative AI, IoT, and Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing for smart cities. My work involves various techniques, such as large language models (LLMs), large sensor models (LSM), efficient machine learning, unsupervised machine learning, cross-domain data fusion, and large-scale system optimization & deployment. I have been investigating platforms across more than 300 cities on 2 continents with 2 billion E-commerce orders, 300 thousand vehicles, 500 thousand mobile devices, and 500 million residents involved. 

### Low-cost & Large-scale Mobile Sensing for Urban Upgrading
With the fast development of urban spaces, urban elements are changing rapidly, especially in developing countries. For example, the opening of new POIs and the emergence of new buildings. By exploiting the unique opportunity brought by mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and smartwatches) carried by citizens, we view volunteering citizens as city sensors and design a new framework for urban sensing. With TB-level multi-modal sensing data (e.g., GPS and WiFi), I have focused on sensing locations of shipping addresses and POIs in 366 cities. The related results have been published in TKDE'24, CIKM'23, and SIGSPATIAL'22. 

### Generative AI
My work focuses on Generative AI for urban infrastructure data generation. Motivated by the unique properties of spatio-temporal and sensory data, I design a DualSTGAN to generate urban road maps from multi-modal sensor data. The related results have been published in Ubicomp'24. 


### Foundation Model for Human Activity Sensing
The ubiquitous adoption of mobile and wearable devices has brought a new opportunity for low-cost human activity sensing. However, two long-standing challenges, *domain shift* and *limited training data*, have impacted the large-scale deployment of activity sensing models. My research aims to develop a foundation model for generalizable activity sensing by designing unique sensor augmentation approaches and sensor pretraining paradigms. The related results have been published in Ubicomp'24.
